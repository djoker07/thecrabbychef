    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      The Crabby Chef started as a personal project to save and share my own
      recipes with friends and family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in development, the idea evolved into making it more of an online
      community board where people can do just that. <br />
      A platform, with simple instructions for cooking enthusiasts. No ads,
      fees, or extra information crowding the screen. <br />
      Just recipes.
    </p>

      Currently working on: (Hopefully done by next update)
      <li>Automatic approval system</li>
      <li>Polishing UI</li>
